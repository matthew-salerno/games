    <h1>My Games</h1>
    <p>These are some of my favorite projects from my ECE 4525 Course: Video Game Design and Engineering. All games are written purely with javascript and the p5 library. Each week we had to write a new game, so some of these games are more rushed than others. Most of my time was spent expanding my "engine", which implemented a simple component based system for entities to interact.</p>
    <h2><a href="games/bee_game/index.html">Bee Game (simple puzzle)</a></h2>
    <p> A simple puzzle game revolving around buttons.
The positioning of characters in the instructions used to be correct in firefox,
but it seems an update has changed that.</p>
    <h2><a href="games/tank_game/index.html">Tank Game</a></h2>
    <p>A tank battle game, of note is the new collision logic.</p>
    <h2><a href="games/pacman/index.html">Pacman</a></h2>
    <p>A Pacman clone. Ghosts will hunt the player using A* if they are close enough.</p>
    <h2><a href="games/3d_table/index.html">3D Table</a></h2>
    <p>A 3d rendering of a table. This uses entirely 2d draw functions and linear algebra to achieve a single point perspective view.</p>
    <h2><a href="games/space_pinball/index.html">Space Scout Pinball</a></h2>
    <p>The final project, based off an old windows favorite of mine, it mostly explores fun physics opposed to fun game design.</p>
